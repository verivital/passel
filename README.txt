Note: to compile x86 on 64-bit, must include option: /platform:x86

* x86: Also, make sure to COPY (clean did not work and gave me hours of debugging trouble) all the files from: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Research\Z3-4.1\bin
* 64-bit: copy (clean did not work) all files from: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Research\Z3-4.1\x64
** These go into the debug directory	C:\Users\tjohnson\Dropbox\Research\tools\passel\repos\trunk\src\dotnet\passel\bin\Debug\
